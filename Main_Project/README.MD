This is where I will be completing my data engineering final project. The project involves building a data pipeline to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources of the NBA, including player statistics, game results, and team information. The goal is to create a comprehensive database that can be used for analysis and visualization of NBA performance metrics. I will be looking at the 2023–24 + 2024–25 NBA seasons. Alongisde with looking at 10 different players as well to look at their performance over the two seasons. So overall I will be looking at a multi-source NBA player performance database.Combining player metadata and game-level statistics across the 2023-24 and 2024-25 NBA season.
I would like to not that exploratory analysis and validation were performed in Jupyter notebooks, while the production data pipeline is implemented in Python scripts to ensure reproducibility.
