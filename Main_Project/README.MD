This is where I will be completing my data engineering final project. The project involves building a data pipeline to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources of the NBA, including player statistics, game results, and team information. The goal is to create a comprehensive database that can be used for analysis and visualization of NBA performance metrics. I will be looking at the 2023–24 + 2024–25 NBA seasons. Alongisde with looking at 10 different players as well to look at their performance over the two seasons.
